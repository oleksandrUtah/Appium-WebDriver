	What is GUI?
There are two types of interfaces for a computer application: 
Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

In GUI you interact with the computer using images (in CLI - text).
GUI Testing is a validation of the GUI elements (menu; buttons; radio buttons; checkboxes …).

To plan your GUI testing, you need a checklist and test order.
